# linode-server-status
Linode server status list

A simple application to get a list of all servers within your linode account and display there current status and ip addresses.

I am planning to add more capability to this application but for now just a simple script to check the status.

For this application to work you must get a API key from your linode account and paste it in assets/plugins/linode/linode.php in the $token variable and that is all your need to so unless you want to return any other information from linode.
